#PC-PART-LIST
#Works like nzxts BLD and pc part picker in suggesting pc parts based on the wants of the user/customer.
#replicates pc part picker or nzxt's way of suggesting pc...
#parts based on factors such as...
#games they want to play, resolution, and the fps target...
#It will then give you feedback like price of parts(and the total)...
#It will also display what parts are included in that list

#Cyberpunk-9/10graphic
